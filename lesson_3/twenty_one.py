'''
RULES:
Deck: standard 52-card deck with 4 suits of 13 values each.
    - 2 - 10 are all worth their face value
    - J, K, Q are all worth 10
    - A can be worth 1 or 11
        - if A is worth 11 and the sum of the hand is > 21, A is worth 1
        - otherwise, A is worth 11

Setup: the game has a dealer and a player
    - both are initially dealt a hand of two cards.
    - the player can see both their cards
    - can see only one of the dealers cards

Player turn: the player alwasy goes first
    - can decide to either hit or stay
    - the turn is over until the player stays or busts

hit: the player wants to be dealt another card
    - if the total exceeds 21, he will bust and lose the game.

dealer turn: the dealer must hit until the total is at least 17.
    - if the dealer busts, the player wins

comparing cards: when both the player and the dealer stay
    - the cards are compared, and whoever has the highest value wins.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
### 1. deal two random cards to both the player and the dealer
### 2.5: calculate the total_card_value of both
### 2. display both cards of the player and one random card of the dealer
### 3. ask the player if they want to hit or stay
### 4. if they hit, deal another card to the player
### 5. calculate the total value of the player
### 6. if the total value is above 21, the player busts, dealer wins
### 7. if not, repeat 3
### 8. if they stay, it is computer's turn
### 9. deal random cards to the computer's hand until the total is at least 17
### 10. if the total is over 21, the computer busts and player wins
### 11. if no bust, the cards are revealed and total is compared
### 12. whoever has the highest total wins the game
